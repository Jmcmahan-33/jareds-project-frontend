# J-Rock Music Lessons 



## Description

The J-Rock Music Lessons is an App that allows students to sign up for music lessons. During sign up the student can pick which teacher they want to conduct lessons with. Fortunately, our teachers are multi talented Rock musicians, so if the student changes their mind on what Intrument they want to play, they have the ability to do so while keeping the same teacher for the Semester. Since, the school is a ever growing business, the app has the ability to hire new teachers. Everytime a student signs up, they will have that ability to pick the teachers. Lastly, if the student wants to cancel lessons, they can go ahead and delete themselves from the student page.
